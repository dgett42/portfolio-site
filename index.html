            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Donovan Getter, and I am a student at the University of South Florida, majoring in Information Assurance and Cybersecurity Management. 
            Upon graduation, I intend to commission into the U.S. Air Force to pursue a career in aviation. I have a strong interest in technology and enjoy expanding my knowledge 
            in areas such as software development, coding, and computer science. In addition to my military career, I aspire to start a small business in the technology field that I can grow over time, 
            with the long-term goal of developing it into a larger venture after retiring from the Air Force.</p>
